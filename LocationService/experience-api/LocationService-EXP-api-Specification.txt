Spec for LocationService EXPERIENCE API

{WIP}
Cover ALL the topics listed in my quick demo 
the other day because it is the service external facing API.

The Diagram (companion file in same folder) should describe 
this time only the workflow between consumer and experience API.

The Diagram should be explicit in order to describe the service
endpoints behavior (sync or async).
 
Describe in this document behaviors not easily translated by RAML

An example would be: a reliable acquisition pattern across experience
and process api.

Client/user/consumer invokes the experience API, experience then 
invokes the process API. Process API runs some business validation,
drops the request payload onto an async topic queue (one-way)
then returns a synchronous ACK to experience, experience back to client
indicating that the payload has been safely delivered and is in process.

Any endpoint supporting an async behavior must have a provision
for a configurable callback address (optionally transport).
Could be an email, a callback URL, a file generated...
