Spec for LocationService Implementation (for lack of a better name)


This doc describes how the system-api encapsulates the back-end system,
how it interracts with it to invoke its supported operations.

Define CRUD if back-end system is a database, a cache...
Define operations and contract if back-end syste is a SaaS exposing a REST API
or a SOAP API.

Define messaging behavior if back-end uses message queues as an integration mechanism 
Could be quite common at Hertz with Websphere MQ.

If the back-end system exposes a well-defined, industry standard REST API it is likely 
that the system-api layer may not be necessary (optional).
